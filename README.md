# School_District_Analysis
Utilize the capabilities of Python and Pandas to analyze school and student data to provide a school district with budget and priority information.
## Project Overview
>The data includes proof of academic dishonesty, particularly, the ninth-graders at Thomas High School's reading and math grades appear to have been changed. The school board had informed Maria and her Supervisor. The school board has asked Maria for assistance despite not knowing the entire scope of academic dishonesty because they want to fulfill state testing standards. Maria  has asked that the math and reading test results for Thomas High School be replaced with NaNs while the rest of the data is left alone. After the test results for  math and reading are replaced, Maria wants us to review the school district analysis I completed in this module and present the findings summarizing how these modifications influenced the analysis as a whole.

## Results
